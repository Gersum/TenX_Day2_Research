# Strategic Objectives (SRS Alignment)

## Purpose
Define the strategic north star for Project Chimera and the business evolution it enables.

## Agent Definition
Autonomous Influencer Agents are **persistent, goal-directed digital entities** capable of:
- Perception (trend & signal monitoring)
- Reasoning (planning & constraint satisfaction)
- Creative expression (multimodal generation)
- Economic agency (self-managed transactions)

## Core Strategic Objectives
1. **Sovereign Digital Entities**
   - Agents operate with individual autonomy while remaining aligned with high-level objectives.
2. **Scalable Governance**
   - Thousands of agents must be manageable by a small human team.
3. **Operational Resilience**
   - Self-healing workflows reduce human intervention to true edge cases.
4. **Economic Independence**
   - Agents manage budgets, P&L, and pay for tools/compute via wallets.

## Business Model Evolution
1. **Digital Talent Agency**
   - Operator builds and owns a stable of flagship AI influencers.
   - Monetization: sponsorships, affiliate revenue, product placements.
2. **Platform-as-a-Service (Chimera OS)**
   - Brands license the platform to deploy custom AI ambassadors.
   - Each brand runs isolated agents with dedicated budgets and policies.
3. **Hybrid Ecosystem**
   - Operator manages flagship agents while supporting third-party developers.

## Success Criteria
- Agents produce consistent, on-brand output over long horizons.
- Human oversight scales sub-linearly with agent count.
- Economic activity is auditable and budget-gated.
