# Governance & Alignment Specification

## 1. BoardKit (Centralized Context)
A single source of truth for policies, brand voice, and ethical boundaries.

**Responsibilities**:

Every agent has a persistent identity defined in a SOUL file.

**Non-Negotiables**:
- Voice is consistent across sessions.
- Values and topics are explicit.
- Persona cannot mutate without explicit governance approval.

## 3. Judge Authority
The Judge agent has veto authority over all outputs.
- **Approve**: Output meets all policy and quality checks.
- **Reject**: Output violates policy or quality rules.
- **Escalate**: Low confidence or high-risk content to human review.

### 3.2 Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)
