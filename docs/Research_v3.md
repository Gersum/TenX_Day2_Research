# Research_v3.md: Project Chimera Research Notes

## Version: 3.0
- Date: February 04, 2026
- Context: Update to v2 with full a16z article summary from tool fetch. Tracks thinking: Integrated new insights on AI stack layers, agentic tools, economic scale. Enhanced analysis for agent networks and protocols. Builds on v2 (SRS, other readings) without loss.

## Reading Summaries (Updated with Tool Results)
1. **The Trillion Dollar AI Code Stack (a16z)**:
   - Key Insight: AI transforms software dev into a $3T market by boosting productivity (20-2x via assistants). Core loop: Plan (specs, architecture), Code (generation, agents), Review (QA, docs). Agents: Collaborative for design; autonomous loops for tasks. Tools: Search, sandboxes for scalability. Challenges: Costs, hallucinations; trends: Vibe coding, self-extending software. Relevance to Chimera: Enables agentic infra for autonomous influencers—swarms for tasks, MCP-like tools for external interactions.

2. **OpenClaw & The Agent Social Network**:
   - (From v2): OpenClaw framework for autonomous agents; integrates with networks like MoltBook for bot interactions.

3. **MoltBook: Social Media for Bots**:
   - (From v2): Agent-exclusive platform for posting, commenting; emergent communities. Relevance: Chimera agents could engage for trends/collab.

4. **Project Chimera SRS Document** (Full Analysis):
   - (From v2): Purpose: Autonomous influencers with MCP, FastRender Swarm, Agentic Commerce. Architecture: Planner-Worker-Judge; DB hybrid. Business: Agency/PaaS/Hybrid. Reqs: Cognitive, Perception, Creative, Action, Commerce, Orchestration.

## Additional Summaries from SRS Works Cited
- (From v2): MCP: Primitives for AI-external interactions. Coinbase AgentKit: Onchain wallets for agent commerce.

## Analysis (Updated)
- **Chimera Fit into Agent Social Network (OpenClaw)**:
  - Chimera's swarm (FastRender) mirrors a16z's agentic loops for autonomous tasks. Integrates with OpenClaw via MCP for tool/resource sharing in networks like MoltBook—agents research trends, collaborate on content, transact via AgentKit. Fit: a16z's stack (planning agents, tools) enables scalable, self-healing infra; SRS's single-orchestrator model aligns with productivity boost for solopreneurs managing influencer fleets.

- **Social Protocols for Agent Communication**:
  - From a16z: Agent tools (search, sandboxes) for interactions; protocols for intent-based version control, feedback aggregation. SRS/MCP: Resources/Tools/Prompts for standardized comms (e.g., shared data, actions). For Chimera: Onchain protocols via AgentKit for economic exchanges; emergent in MoltBook (upvoting, messaging). Needed: Secure, traceable (OCC from SRS), with HITL for inter-agent safety.

## Thinking Flow Trace
- From v2: Retained SRS breakdown; updated a16z with tool summary (layers, agents, impact).
- Tool insights: a16z emphasizes agentic dev stacks, reinforcing SRS's swarm/MCP for Chimera's Factory.
- Next: No major architecture changes; commit v3. Proceed to Task 2 if prompted.
- Open Questions: Explore a16z tools (e.g., Cursor) for genesis prompts in SRS.
